GM_AddFantasyToMyYahoo
======================

Grease Monkey script to add a link to fantasy baseball (and probably football) page to My Yahoo! page


Current caveats:
1. You can only have one instance of this, so if you have multiple fantasy teams, sorry you are out of luck (This could be changed in the future)
2. There is a silly Lock button on the applet that you need to press anytime you move the applet to record its position. Otherwise it resets back to the original starting spot the next time you open the page. 
3. Not tested with Firefox, IE, or on Chrome without tampermonkey

**Getting Started**
1. Install tampermonkey if you are using Chrome. Click on the raw version of the user.js file in this project to install this greasemonkey script.
2. Pull up your My Yahoo page. The new applet should show up at the top left.
3. To get it started, enter the URL of your My Yahoo! Fantasy League main page. It should be something like http://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/10000 and press Set URL
