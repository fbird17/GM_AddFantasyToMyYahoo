GM_AddFantasyToMyYahoo
======================

Grease Monkey script to add a link to fantasy baseball (and probably football) page to My Yahoo! page

Tested with Firefox (GreaseMonkey) and Chrome (tampermonkey).

Current caveats:
 1.  Does not work on IE. Untested with Chrome w/o tampermonkey.
 2.  Not tested with anything other than baseball.

**Getting Started**
---------------------
 1.  Firefox: Install Greasemonkey
 2.  Chrome: Install tampermonkey
 3.  Click on the raw version of the user.js file in this project to install this greasemonkey script
 4.  Pull up your My Yahoo! page. Make sure you are logged in.  The new applet should show up at the top left.
