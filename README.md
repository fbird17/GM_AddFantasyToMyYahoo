GM_AddFantasyToMyYahoo
======================

Grease Monkey script to add a link to fantasy baseball (and probably football) page to My Yahoo! page

Tested with Firefox (GreaseMonkey) and Chrome (tampermonkey).

Current caveats:
1. Only supports one league at a time. (This may be changed in the future).
2. Does not work on IE. Untested with Chrome w/o tampermonkey.

**Getting Started**
1. Firefox: Install Greasemonkey
2. Chrome: Install tampermonkey
3. Click on the raw version of the user.js file in this project to install this greasemonkey script
2. Pull up your My Yahoo! page. Make sure you are logged in.  The new applet should show up at the top left.
3. To get it started, enter the URL of your My Yahoo! Fantasy League main page. It should be something like http://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/10000 and press Set URL
